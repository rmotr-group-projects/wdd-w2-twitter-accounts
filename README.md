# Twitter Profile

For this project we'll have to extend our previous Twitter timeline project to include a profile view for our user which will allow her to update her personal information **and her profile picture**.

This project can end up being considerably easier to solve than the previous ones. In that case, the power of Django will be evident. We recommend you to take a look at the [documentation about managing files](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/topics/files/) and in particular, to the [ImageField reference](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ImageField).

As usual, here's a list of pages to show how it should look:

### Home page for user with profile picture

### User's profile page without profile pic

(A default image should be included)
